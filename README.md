# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 


Title of presentation: Fragile family

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Clear descriptions of data used in the analysis

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Not very clear explanations for data cleaning process



Title of presentation: Predicting voter turnout

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Good to present limitations on dataset; good to point out the false positive problems; seem to know pretty much about the data and the direction of your project (e.g. using individual-level data)

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
(1) From your presentation, the shiny apps tell us the pattern (which variables matter in each state), but we can't really know the nature of influence (e.g. positive or negative); also, suppose there are more married people in a given state, which makes marriage an important predictor in the state, this does not entail that marriage is a more effective predictor in that state 
(2) State-level analysis would be very helpful


Title of presentation: Tourist reviews of las vegas restaurant on Yelp

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Very interesting to include trip type and objectivity; good use of hierarchical clustering and text analysis (very interesting analysis!)

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: the thesis and the analysis itself does not seem to match well



Title of presentation: Crime in Chicago

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Like the way you explain the relationship between types of crime and weather features

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: More rationale about how the "small blocks" are created might help!


Title of presentation: Game

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Good to give audience some background information and some relevant research that has been done in the field; clearly explain the goals of this project; I like the way you guys take questions - it really shows that you know your models pretty well

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: The unit of analysis and the methods used to build the features were not very clearly explained; It's better to establish some common ground (e.g. x and y, variables) before getting into the results parts; participants self-select into different conditions (not randomized) - be more careful about making generalization


Title of presentation: H1b
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Narrow down research questions to a approachable level through visualization processes

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: The company type is associated with a given state's political preferences, but it does not really tell us much about H1B applicants - in ohter words, we don't know if it's the company type that makes the difference, regardless of H1B appications (All STEM companies, with or without a friendly foreign employment policy, tend to be located in liberal states) >> I feel like the conclusion comes with some limitations regarding what kind of information we can get from this analysis

Title of presentation: traffic
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: great combining data from different sources; good to find out some weird things through visualization and adress them (e.g. weight number of car accident by population); presentation very structured and focused; interpret plots very clearly

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: residual plots might need more elaboration; not control for county?


Title of presentation: songs
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: good to ackownledge the context is ignored; I think the research question is very interesting - combininig sentiment and rhyme and look into this relationship over years


What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: the first part of the analysis is descriptive; the type of music might moderate the association?; better to validate self-definition of new features


Title of presentation: NBA analysis
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: really interesing research questions; great visualization

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: most of the analysis is descriptive (or haven't got enough time to get to that part?); how do you deal with dependence in time-series analysis (e.g. performancae and salary)? More rationale for taking away the over-time section might help.

Title of presentation: Terrorism
What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: good visualization; nice interpretation of the plots and figures in presentation

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: would love to listen to your time series analysis if we had time; should address outliers more seriously (with some more explanations or rationale)
