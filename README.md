# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 


Title of presentation: Fragile family

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Clear descriptions of data used in the analysis

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Not very clear explanations for data cleaning process



Title of presentation: Predicting voter turnout

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Good to present limitations on dataset; good to point out the false positive problems; seem to know pretty much about the data and the direction of your project (e.g. using individual-level data)

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: 
(1) From your presentation, the shiny apps tell us the pattern (which variables matter in each state), but we can't really know the nature of influence (e.g. positive or negative); also, suppose there are more married people in a given state, which makes marriage an important predictor in the state, this does not entail that marriage is a more effective predictor in that state 
(2) State-level analysis would be very helpful


Title of presentation: Tourist reviews of las vegas restaurant on Yelp

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Very interesting to include trip type and objectivity; good use of hierarchical clustering and text analysis (very interesting analysis!)

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: the thesis and the analysis itself does not seem to match well



Title of presentation: Crime in Chicago

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Like the way you explain the relationship between types of crime and weather features

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: More rationale about how the "small blocks" are created might help!
